					A full stack application to serve as a contract management
					system for Brazos Valley Council of Governments.
					<br />
					BVCOG sent contracts electronically to the
					contracts@bvcog.org email address, with very little
					description as to what the contract was about, who it was
					with, when it expired, and whether it could be renewed.
					<br />
					Sometimes contracts would expire without them taking the
					appropriate action, or they would continue perpetually on a
					month-to-month basis resulting in disallowed costs.
					<br />
					<br />
					Some features include an Amazon-style review system for
					vendors. Users can review vendors based on how previous
					contracts went so that better vendors can be selected in the
					future.
					<br />
					Highly-customizable reports can be generated in Portable
					Document Format for both users and contracts.
					<br />
					Uses RSpec and Cucumber to ensure test-driven development
					and behavior-driven development.

					Retrieving specific information from vast video data on
					platforms like YouTube presents a formidable challenge due
					to the limitations of traditional metadata-based methods.
					<br />
					These methods often struggle to capture the intricacies of
					video content accurately.
					<br />
					Additionally, the sheer amount of content uploaded to
					YouTube ensures that a comprehensively nuanced search would
					take an unreasonable amount of time and effort.
					<br />
					By storing YouTube transcripts and developing a dedicated
					website, this solution aims to enhance search experiences,
					optimizing performance while maintaining a balance between
					speed and accuracy.
					<br />
					The system enables flexible searches with sorting and
					filtering capabilities, empowering users to efficiently
					locate videos based on specific words or phrases they
					recall.
					<br />
					Evaluation encompasses rigorous unit testing, integration
					testing, user acceptance testing, and user studies to ensure
					both functionality and user satisfaction.
					<br />
					Overall, the website provides an effective tool for
					navigating and accessing video content with precision and
					ease.

					A project that I have been apart of is the Simulation

					Some of the work I did on this project can be found on the
					team&apos;s GitHub page found{" "}
					<Link href={rm_github}>here</Link>.
					<br />
					<br />
					The purpose of the simulation was to be able to emulate the
					robots developed by the team along with their control
					capabilities.
					<br />
					Certain robots would be manually controlled while others
					were automated.
					<br />
					At times, the physical robots were unavailable to the
					Computer Vision team as the Hardware team were working on
					the robots to make them better.
					<br />
					<br />
					To solve this problem, the CV Team created the Simulation
					SubTeam to create a simulation.
					<br />
					With this Simulation, they would hope to be able to test
					their new algorithms.
					<br />
					Some of these algorithms include, new de-noise algorithms,
					more optimal armor plate detector.

					<br />
					<br />
					Additionally, this projeect helped me learn about the

					<br />
					Software engineering tasks such as Design, Implementation,
					Testing and Maintanence.
					<br />
					This also assisted me alot in learning about bug testing and
					determining the origin of bugs.
					<br />
					<br />
					Future plans for this software include:
					<br />
					Connecting the program to the internet to allow users to
					play on this software remotely
					<br />
					Add security to ensure only moves are sent and processed.
					<br />
					Training a Machine Learning algorithm to play chess.
					<br />
					Implementing other variants of Chess such as Chess960, Fog
					of War, or Duck Chess.
