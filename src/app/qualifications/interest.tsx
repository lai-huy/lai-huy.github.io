				I am interested in learning more about Cybersecurity.
				<br />
				As more of our world becomes digitized, technology and its
				capabilities will become increasingly intertwined with our
				lives.
				<br />
				As a result, Cybersecurity will be criticalin ensuring that
				these devices cannot be compromised by malicious attackers.
				<br />
				Additionally, an increasing amount of personal data about
				users will be more readily available as more of these
				devices begin to communicate with one another.
				<br />
				It is essentual that these systems cannot be compromised.

				Additionally, I am intereted in Machine Learning.
				<br />
				With the need for increased automation with in our new
				digitized word, machine learning will help is ensuring that
				these automated systems can respond to potential problems.
				<br />
				We have seen the capabilities of Machine Learning with
				DeepMind&apos;s AlphaGo.
